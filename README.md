Hello,

This is a repository was created for my bookingGo Tech test. The project was created using create-react-app. So all the usual commands are available. 

To get the app up and running, clone the repo using the above link.

Then install all project dependencies using 'npm install'.

Once that is complete navigate to the project folder and use 'npm start' to start localhost:3000 and view the app. 

You can also see my unit tests for each of the components and run them using 'npm test'

Future Refactoring opportunities: 
1) add debounce to the onChange method so it only makes a call to the API once the user is done typing
2) more comprehensive (non-snapshot) tests for each components to increase coverage and codebase confidence

- I would of implemented these changes, but I wanted to submit for your consideration asap. Hope you like my implementation.
